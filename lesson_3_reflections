When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository might be useful for sharing code with others and also using code that others have shared that are in the repo. It is also a safe backup in the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not want the local changes automatically shared with the public or other collaborators e.g. when testing experimental features
